title: About me
---

I am a Senior Justice Policy Analyst at the Harris County Justice Administration Department in Houston, TX. I identify, analyze, and study the implementation of policies to facilitate public safety, justice, and equality in Harris County, without the involvement of punitive criminal justice institutions.

I am very nearly finished with my PhD in Cornell University's Government Department, where I studied Race, Ethnicity, and Politics, Policy Studies, and American Political Development.  Prior to my study at Cornell, I worked in local politics, consulting for multiple local races in Southwestern Michigan, and managed a State Representative's re-election campaign.

I grew up in exurban Detroit, and got my B.A. at Kalamazoo College.  I do my best to fill my free time with watching and playing sports, drinking coffee and beer, weight training, and listening to sleepy music.
