title: About me
---

I study political attitude and identity at formation at Cornell University, where I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Government Department.  My dissertation examines how DACA shaped the political attitudes and racial/ethnic identities of the Dreamers.

More broadly, my work sits at the intersection of Race, Ethnicity, and Politics, Policy Studies, and American Political Development.  Prior to my study at Cornell, I worked in local politics, consulting for multiple local races in Southwestern Michigan, and managed a State Representative's re-election campaign.

I grew up in exurban Detroit, and got my B.A. at Kalamazoo College.  I do my best to fill my free time with watching and playing sports, drinking coffee and beer, weight training, and listening to sleepy music.  When I can, my favorite thing to do is to get lost in the mountains near Ithaca.
