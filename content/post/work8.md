My dissertation examines how DACA shaped the political attitudes and racial/ethnic identities of the Dreamers.  The program's arbitrary cutoffs enable me to identify how the initiative shaped the attitudes of the eligible relative to the most narrowly ineligible.  I find largely adverse results.

<!--more-->

I draw on numerous surveys of political attitudes and behavior that oversample Latinx and Asian Americans to identify DACA's influence.  I draw on theories of immigrant incorporation, policy feedback, and policy threats to identify attitudes and identities that are most likely to respond to the initiative.

My dissertation presents evidence that DACA did not bolster the American identification, panethnic identity or solidarity, or engagement with politics of those eligible.  On the other hand, the policy appears to have diminished the American identification and political interest of some groups of eligible Americans.  Finally, I present evidence of different responses among different ethnic groups.

## Next steps

My future research into DACA's influence on American politics will include:

- participating in the 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-election Survey to measure DACA uptake.
- examining how DACA catalyzed policy feedback effects in the public at large.
- tracing how different organizations leveraged identity claims in their immigration reform advocacy.
- describing the prevalence of strategic/confounding reports of immigration status on public opinion surveys, and identifying the predictors of confounding reports.

## Above

DACA eligbility is negatively associated with American identification in Latinx Americans.
