One of my papers under review examines how individuals' perceptions of their panethnic group's discrimination relative to other groups predicts their vote choice.
<!--more-->

In this paper, with Justin Berry, and Sergio Garcia-Rios, we draw on theories of group positioning and political polarization to develop a theory of how Americans locate their panethnic group in the American racial hierarchy.  Furthermore, we present evidence of how those perceptions influence Americans' vote choice.

We draw on data from numerous vintages of the Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey, and the American National Elections Study.

## Next steps

My future research into DACA's influence on American politics will include:

- examining how DACA catalyzed policy feedback effects in the public at large.
- tracing how different organizations leveraged identity claims in their immigration reform advocacy.
- describing the prevalence of strategic/confounding reports of immigration status on public opinion surveys, and identifying the predictors of confounding reports.
