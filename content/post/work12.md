Extensive discussion after the 2016 Elections framed low support for Clinton amongst Sanders primary voters as an explanation for Clinton's disappointing Electoral College performance.  How well does that claim hold up?

<!--more-->

In a working analysis with Justin Berry and Adriana Vance, we examine state-by-state variation in the proportion of Sanders voters who voted for Clinton in the general election.  We identify substantial state-by-state variation, suggesting that a compelling explanation needs to incorporate additional evidence beyond candidate favorability.

[In this dynamic plot](https://www.colincepuran.com/img/forweb), we provide some evidence that Sanders supporters were less likely to vote for Clinton if a) the state was very uncompetitive in 2016 (i.e. NY, CA, WV, KY), b) the state was *perceived* as uncompetitive in 2016, or c), Sanders can be inferred to have benefited from an anti-Clinton vote in the primaries (again, WV, KY).

In states that ultimately were more competitive (i.e. WI, NC, NH), Sanders supporters broke for Clinton with far more reliability.  There is some additional evidence that campaign infrastructure (i.e. IA, NH) could have played a role in converting Sanders supporters.
