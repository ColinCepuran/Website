title: Unexpected bias in syllabi construction
weight: 8
writer: Colin Cepuran
---

One of my working papers (with Cameron Mailhot) presents evidence of primary and recency bias in political science syllabi construction, leading to authors at the very beginning and end of the alphabet being overrepresented in syllabi.

We draw on theories of primacy and recency bias, as well as common practices in how references are ordered and files stored, to suggest that authors might be unconsciously predisposed to include works by authors whose names begin with "A" or "Z" on their syllabi.  We support those claims by comparing a well-known collection of syllabi to a "control group" of first author names collected from the three most prominent political science journals.

## Above

First authors with last names starting with "A" and "Z" are overrepresented in political science syllabi relative to top journals.
