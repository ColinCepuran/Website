This paper (with Justin Berry)--under review--presents preliminary evidence that, despite prominent theories suggesting a relationship, segregation is not correlated with white racial identity attachment or consciousness.
<!--more-->

In this paper, we draw on theories of group competition, urban politics, and the construction of race/ethnicity to indicate reasons to expect a relationship between segregation and white identity.  We draw on data from the 2008 National Politics Study and Jessica Trounstine's data on segregation in the United States to test that relationship.

Unexpectedly, we present evidence that numerous measures of segregation are uncorrelated with whites' racial identity attachment or consciousness.

## Next steps

This research presents evidence that scholars should study:

- what *does* antecede identity attachment in whites?
- how other racial/ethnic groups' identities respond to their context.

## Above

Predicted levels of white racial identity attachment do not change at different levels of segregation.  Source: authors' calculations.
